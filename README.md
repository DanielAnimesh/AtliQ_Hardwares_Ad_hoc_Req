# Resume Project Challenge - Ad Hoc Insights (Round 4)

## **Problem Statement**
Atliq Hardware, a leading computer hardware manufacturer in India and other regions, is struggling to make prompt and data-driven decisions. To overcome this challenge, the management has decided to expand its data analytics team. Tony Sharma, the head of data analytics, has initiated an SQL challenge to identify candidates with strong technical and analytical skills.

This project involves extracting actionable insights from sales and product data using **SQL and Power BI**, helping Atliq Hardware improve its strategic decision-making process.
